workstation-bootstrapper
========================

Setting up a new machine is a PTA. This makes it easier.

The script itself installs only the basics like homebrew and rvm.
However, a dotfiles repository can be provided that can be automatically
installed

## Usage

`curl -L https://raw.github.com/effkay/workstation-bootstrapper/master/bootstrap.sh | bash`

Or if you have a dotfiles repo with install script (see [mine](https://github.com/effkay/dotfiles) for
reference):

`curl -L https://raw.github.com/effkay/workstation-bootstrapper/master/bootstrap.sh | bash -s -d https://your-dotfiles.com`
